title: Vietnamese charcoal grilled pork skewers
date: 2020-06-22
ingredients:
  - pork belly, 500g
  - shallot, 3 or 15g
  - lemongrass, 10g
  - caramel, 2 tbsp
  - fish sauce, 2 tbsp
  - ajinomoto or MSG, 5g
  - oyster sauce, 2 tbsp
  - honey, 1 tsp or 10g
  - sesame oil, 1 tsp or 10g
  - pepper, 3g
tips:
  - Put the pork belly in the freezer for 5-10 minutes before attempting to remove the skin. It will make the process much easier. While waiting for the meat to become more solid, you can start preparing the ingredients for the marinade.
steps:
  - Peel and chop shallots with lemongrass into smaller pieces
  - Put all the ingredients except for the pork belly into a food prep machine and just mince them all together
  - Take off the skin on the pork belly because if you keep the skin, when you grill the skewers, the skin will pop and it might hurt you
  - Slice the pork belly into 2cm wide strips
  - Thinly slice each strip into 0.5cm or less pieces in terms of thickness
  - Marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight, before starting to put them on a skewer
  - Put all the meat on skewers, prepare your charcoal BBQ and grill them!
