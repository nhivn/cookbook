ingredients:
  - large eggs, 6
  - milk
  - salt
  - pepper
  - cheese, optional
  - butter
steps:
  - "In a mixing bowl, add 6 large eggs with: 
  <ul>
  <li>1.5 tbsp of milk</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
  <li>a pinch of pepper</li>
  </ul>
  "
  - Gently whisk the eggs until everything looks well blended.
  - On low heat, spray oil and add butter (1 tbsp or to your taste really) to a non-stick pan.
  - Once butter melted, pour in the eggs mixture.
  - Move your spatula along the side of your pan through out the process, pulling the eggs into the middle. This is to make sure we don't accidentally overcook the eggs.
  - When the eggs start to look less liquidy, add in the grated cheese. The amount of cheese is to your taste.
  - Repeat step 5 until the eggs is cooked to your taste. The longer you leave it in the pan, the less moist and soft it will be.
