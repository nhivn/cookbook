  - While the pork belly is frying, dice the red onion and garlic cloves into small pieces
  - Cut the spring onions' white root part and thinly slice them *vertically*. I usually just slice it 4 times.
  - Chop the green part of the spring onion.
  - "Make the sauce ðŸ¥£ with: 
  <ul>
  <li>1/2 salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp of Ajinomoto</li>
  <li>2g of salt</li>
  <li>2 tbsp of fish sauce</li>
  </ul>

  - Once the pork belly pieces look cooked with slightly burnt corners, add the red onion, garlic and spring onion roots.
  - When all the onions and garlics you added previous starts to smell good, pour in the sauce and mix everything together well on medium low heat.
  - When the meat looks sticky and glowy and dewy and all delicious, just before turning off the stove, add pepper to taste and the green bits of spring onion.
