ingredients:
  - pork belly, 400g
  - red onion, half
  - garlic, 2 cloves
  - spring onion, 2 to 3 stalks
  - fish sauce
  - ajinomoto or Vietnamese spice
  - sugar
  - salt
  - pepper
steps:
  - Clean the pork belly.
  - Cut it into 1-2 cm wide and 0.5 cm thick pieces.
  - Marinate the pork belly pieces with 1 tbsp of sugar.
  - On high heat, fry the pork belly to golden brown. Check out the next steps now.
  - While the pork belly is frying, dice the red onion and garlic cloves into small pieces
  - Cut the spring onions' white root part and thinly slice them *vertically*. I usually just slice it 4 times.
  - Chop the green part of the spring onion.
  - "Make the sauce ü•£ with: 
  <ul>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp of Ajinomoto or Vietnamese Spice</li>
  <li>2 tbsp of fish sauce</li>
  </ul>
  "
  - Once the pork belly pieces look cooked with slightly burnt corners, add the red onion, garlic and spring onion roots.
  - When all the onions and garlics you added previous starts to smell good, pour in the sauce and mix everything together well on medium low heat.
  - When the meat looks sticky and glowy and dewy and all delicious, just before turning off the stove, add pepper to taste and the green bits of spring onion.
