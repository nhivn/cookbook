A recipe has:
* `title`: Self-explanatory
* `slug`: I failed to figure out a way to add `slug` to `allRecipe` so have to do this manually
* `ingredients`: Self-explanatory
* `steps`: Cooking instruction
* `note` (optional): Anything the reader need to be mindful about when cooking the recipe
* `tips` (optional): Self-explanatory
